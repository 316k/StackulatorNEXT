# StackulatorNEXT

StackulatorNEXT is a functionnal, stacked-based and minimalistic programming language.

It's the spiritual descendant of [Stackulator II](https://github.com/316k/stackulator-ii).

## Example code

```
5 10 / print cr
# prints 1/2

250 -> a
a 10 / -> a
a print cr
# prints 25

# functions

(dup *) -> squared
5 squared . print
# prints 25
```
